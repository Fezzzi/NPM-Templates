## NPM Templates
My personal commonly used React/Node templates

### Templates
#### react-redux-js-starter
Template for robust `React` + `Redux` web application. Includes custom `webpack` configuration with bundle splitting, few custom path aliases and my preferred `eslint` configuration. Ships with `connected-router` and configured `rootReducer` that places it into Redux state, `material-UI` icons installed and onfigured, and minimal proxy server build with `node` on top of `express` to tackle `CORS` issues during local development. Styling is done using `styled-components.
